A simple C# application to swap control configurations easily for different racing disciplines. iRacing provides a basic functionality to have custom controls per car which can be time consuming to configure per car. This application stores a list of your control files within the iRacing documents file allowing you to swap out control files to match the car you're looking to race quickly.

 ## Future improvements:
- Allow the user to select preset images or import images of custom wheels.
- Look into if it's possible to auto detect the car being loaded in the simulator and automatically select the controls file to match.
- See if it's possible to hotswap configuration files once the simulator is had already loaded.
